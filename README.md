Some apps or games (like banking apps) will check for the Magisk app package, additionally to safetynet and root for which there is already a solution. However, the Magisk app can be hidden by disabling the package and will therefor not be detected anymore. MagiskToggle is a QSTile which does exactly that, it's a quick way to disable and enable Magisk when needed. You can download and install the latest apk [here](https://github.com/Yanndroid/MagiskToggle/raw/master/app/release/app-release.apk).
